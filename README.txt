1. INTRODUCTION

BPPA-2DFD implements algorithms and benchmark instances used for beam 
propagation in the paraxial approximation (BPPA) via 2D finite-difference
time domain methods (2DFD) 

This first commit is used for code review in TP2 of the HYMNOS project
at the Hannover Centre for Optical Technologies. It represents a common
project of TP1 and TP2 within HYMNOS


2. DEPENDENCIES

BPPA-2DFD requires the functionality of NumPy, a fundamental package for
scientific computing (see www.numpy.org).


3. LICENSE

None, yet.
